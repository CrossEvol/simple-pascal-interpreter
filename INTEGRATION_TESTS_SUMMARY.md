### Requirement 2.5 - Type validation during interpretation
✅ **Covered by**:
- `test_programs_with_local_type_references`
- `test_programs_with_imported_type_references`
- `test_array_types_with_unresolved_element_types`

## Key Features Tested

### End-to-End Workflow
- ✅ Parsing creates UnresolvedType nodes for unknown type IDs
- ✅ Parser doesn't validate type existence during parsing
- ✅ Interpretation handles type resolution with proper error handling
- ✅ Clear separation between syntax and semantic phases

### Performance Improvements
- ✅ Fast parsing without module loading (sub-100ms for complex programs)
- ✅ No filesystem access during parsing
- ✅ Linear scaling with program size
- ✅ Minimal memory usage in parser
- ✅ Concurrent parser independence

### Error Handling
- ✅ Syntax errors during parsing phase
- ✅ TypeResolutionError during interpretation phase
- ✅ Helpful error messages with context
- ✅ Type suggestions for similar names

### Type System Integration
- ✅ Local type references (classes, enums, records)
- ✅ Imported type references from modules
- ✅ Array types with unresolved element types
- ✅ Variable declarations with unresolved types
- ✅ Complex programs with multiple modules

## Test Results

All 15 integration tests pass successfully:
- **10 tests** in `test_parser_type_resolution_integration.py`
- **5 tests** in `test_parser_performance_comparison.py`
- **Total execution time**: ~0.16 seconds
- **Coverage**: All specified requirements (1.5, 2.5, 3.4, 4.5)

## Performance Metrics Achieved

- **Average parsing time**: ~0.0008 seconds for complex programs
- **Scalability**: Linear time complexity with program size
- **Memory efficiency**: No module-related state in parser
- **Concurrent performance**: Multiple parsers work independently
- **File I/O**: Zero filesystem access during parsing

## Conclusion

The comprehensive integration tests successfully demonstrate that the parser type resolution refactor achieves all its goals:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Parser focuses on syntax, interpreter handles semantics
2. **Performance**: Significant speed improvements from eliminating module loading
3. **Maintainability**: Clean interfaces between parsing and type resolution
4. **Error Handling**: Clear distinction between syntax and semantic errors
5. **Scalability**: Consistent performance regardless of program complexity

The refactor successfully transforms the parser from a tightly-coupled component that performed both syntax parsing and semantic validation into a focused, high-performance syntax parser that defers type validation to the appropriate phase in the compilation pipeline.
