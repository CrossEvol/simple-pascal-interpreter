# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create ExitSignal class for control flow
  - Add ExitSignal class to src/spi/error.py that inherits from Exception
  - Include exit_type parameter to distinguish between procedure and function exits
  - Ensure lightweight design with minimal overhead
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Implement Exit procedure handler function
  - Create handle_exit() function in src/spi/interpreter.py following existing built-in procedure patterns
  - Add proper logging with ENTER/LEAVE messages matching other built-in procedures
  - Validate that Exit() is called without parameters (Pascal standard behavior)
  - Determine current context (procedure, function, or program) for appropriate ExitSignal type
  - Raise ExitSignal to trigger control flow termination
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 3. Register Exit procedure with built-in system
  - Add handle_exit registration to interpreter __init__ method
  - Use existing NativeMethod.EXIT enum value for registration
  - Follow same pattern as other built-in procedures like WRITE and WRITELN
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Add ExitSignal handling to user-defined procedure calls
  - Modify visit_ProcedureCall() method to catch ExitSignal after executing procedure block
  - Ensure ExitSignal is only caught for user-defined procedures, not built-in procedures
  - Maintain proper call stack cleanup and logging when Exit is called
  - Preserve activation record state during signal handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Add ExitSignal handling to user-defined function calls
  - Modify visit_FunctionCall() method to catch ExitSignal after executing function block
  - Preserve function return value that was set before Exit was called
  - Ensure proper return value extraction from activation record
  - Maintain call stack integrity during signal handling
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Write comprehensive unit tests for Exit functionality
  - Create test cases for Exit in simple procedures and functions
  - Test Exit within nested control structures (if statements, loops)
  - Verify function return value preservation when Exit is called
  - Test Exit in nested procedure/function call scenarios
  - Add tests for proper call stack behavior with Exit
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Add ExitSignal handling to main program execution
  - Modify visit_Program() method to catch ExitSignal for program-level Exit calls
  - Ensure program-level Exit terminates the entire program execution
  - Maintain proper program termination semantics
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Validate Exit behavior with existing test cases
  - Run test_exit_for_procedure test case to verify procedure Exit behavior
  - Run test_exit_for_function test case to verify function Exit behavior
  - Execute exit_procedure.pas file to test real Pascal program behavior
  - Execute exit_function.pas file to test function return value preservation
  - Test Exit with parameters to ensure proper error handling
  - Ensure all existing interpreter tests still pass
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.1_
