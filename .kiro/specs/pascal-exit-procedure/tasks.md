# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create ExitSignal class for control flow





  - Add ExitSignal class to src/spi/error.py that inherits from Exception
  - Include exit_type parameter to distinguish between procedure and function exits
  - Ensure lightweight design with minimal overhead
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Implement Exit procedure handler function





  - this project use uv 
  - Create handle_exit() function in src/spi/interpreter.py following existing built-in procedure patterns
  - Add proper logging with ENTER/LEAVE messages matching other built-in procedures
  - Validate that Exit() is called without parameters (Pascal standard behavior)
  - Determine current context (procedure, function, or program) for appropriate ExitSignal type
  - Raise ExitSignal to trigger control flow termination
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Register Exit procedure with built-in system





  - this project use uv 
  - ignore testcases inside `test_interpreter` now out of MockCallStack has different behaviors, only use `make run file=exit_procedure.pas` for test usage , or use `make test` to ensure do not break
  - Add handle_exit registration to interpreter __init__ method
  - Use existing NativeMethod.EXIT enum value for registration
  - Follow same pattern as other built-in procedures like WRITE and WRITELN
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Add ExitSignal handling to user-defined procedure calls





  - this project use uv 
  - ignore testcases inside `test_interpreter` now out of MockCallStack has different behaviors, only use `make run file=exit_procedure.pas` for test usage , or use `make test` to ensure do not break
  - Modify visit_ProcedureCall() method to catch ExitSignal after executing procedure block
  - Ensure ExitSignal is only caught for user-defined procedures, not built-in procedures
  - Maintain proper call stack cleanup and logging when Exit is called
  - Preserve activation record state during signal handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Add ExitSignal handling to user-defined function calls








  - currently the CallStack will copy from and back values from ActivationRecord, maybe you can change the impl inside it, ActivationRecord should have its previous AR ref, then lookup will not only see itself , maybe this approach is better 
  - this project use uv 
  - ignore testcases inside `test_interpreter` now out of MockCallStack has different behaviors, only use `make run file=exit_procedure.pas` or `make run file=exit_function.pas` for test usage , or use `make test` to ensure do not break
  - Modify visit_FunctionCall() method to catch ExitSignal after executing function block
  - Preserve function return value that was set before Exit was called
  - Ensure proper return value extraction from activation record
  - Maintain call stack integrity during signal handling
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Write comprehensive unit tests for Exit functionality









  - this project use uv 
  - use `make test` to ensure do not break
  - see `test_interpreter.py` and write Exit related testcases inside it
  - Create test cases for Exit in simple procedures and functions
  - Test Exit within nested control structures (if statements, loops), you should refer to current testcases, cause i have not impl complete pascal control structures
  - Verify function return value preservation when Exit is called
  - Test Exit in nested procedure/function call scenarios
  - Add tests for proper call stack behavior with Exit
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Add ExitSignal handling to main program execution
  - this project use uv 
  - use `make test` to ensure do not break
  - Modify visit_Program() method to catch ExitSignal for program-level Exit calls
  - Ensure program-level Exit terminates the entire program execution
  - Maintain proper program termination semantics
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Validate Exit behavior with existing test cases
  - this project use uv 
  - use `make test` to ensure do not break
  - Execute exit_procedure.pas file to test real Pascal program behavior
  - Execute exit_function.pas file to test function return value preservation
  - Test Exit with parameters to ensure proper error handling
  - Ensure all existing interpreter tests still pass
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.1_
