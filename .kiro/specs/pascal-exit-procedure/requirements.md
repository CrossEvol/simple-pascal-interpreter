# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for Pascal's Exit procedure to the existing Pascal interpreter. The Exit procedure allows early termination from procedures and functions, providing control flow similar to return statements in other languages. This is a standard Pascal feature that enables developers to exit from the current procedure or function before reaching the end of the block.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want to use the Exit procedure in my functions and procedures, so that I can terminate execution early when certain conditions are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pascal program calls Exit() in a procedure THEN the interpreter SHALL immediately terminate the current procedure and return control to the caller
2. WHEN a Pascal program calls Exit() in a function THEN the interpreter SHALL immediately terminate the current function and return the current function value to the caller
3. WHEN Exit() is called with no parameters THEN the interpreter SHALL use a default exit behavior (terminate current procedure/function)
4. WHEN Exit() is called in nested procedure/function calls THEN the interpreter SHALL only exit the immediate current procedure/function, not the entire program

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want Exit to work correctly with the existing control flow structures, so that my programs behave predictably when Exit is called within loops or conditional statements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Exit() is called within a for loop inside a procedure THEN the interpreter SHALL exit the procedure immediately, not just the loop
2. WHEN Exit() is called within a while loop inside a function THEN the interpreter SHALL exit the function immediately, not just the loop
3. WHEN Exit() is called within an if statement inside a procedure THEN the interpreter SHALL exit the procedure immediately
4. WHEN Exit() is called in a nested compound statement THEN the interpreter SHALL exit the current procedure/function completely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want Exit to integrate seamlessly with the existing built-in procedure system, so that it follows the same patterns as other built-in procedures like Write and WriteLn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interpreter encounters Exit in the source code THEN it SHALL recognize it as a built-in procedure
2. WHEN Exit is called THEN it SHALL be processed through the same native method handling system as other built-in procedures
3. WHEN Exit is registered THEN it SHALL follow the same registration pattern as existing built-in procedures
4. WHEN Exit is executed THEN it SHALL maintain proper call stack logging and debugging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Pascal interpreter, I want the Exit implementation to be robust and maintainable, so that it doesn't break existing functionality and can be easily extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Exit is implemented THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing interpreter functionality
2. WHEN Exit is called THEN it SHALL properly clean up the current activation record
3. WHEN Exit terminates a function THEN it SHALL preserve the function's return value that was set before Exit was called
4. WHEN Exit is used in recursive functions THEN it SHALL only exit the current recursion level
5. WHEN the interpreter processes Exit THEN it SHALL maintain thread safety and proper state management
