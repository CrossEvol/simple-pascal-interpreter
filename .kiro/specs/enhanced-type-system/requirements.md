# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the Pascal interpreter's type system by adding comprehensive TypeSymbol classes and implementing type operations for stronger semantic checking. Currently, the type system lacks specific TypeSymbol classes for basic types (INTEGER, REAL, BOOLEAN, CHAR) and doesn't support type-level operations that could strengthen compile-time validation. The goal is to create a robust type system that can perform type calculations and validations during semantic analysis while maintaining clear separation from runtime objects used by the interpreter.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on semantic analysis, I want comprehensive TypeSymbol classes for all Pascal data types so that the type system can perform accurate type checking and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the semantic analyzer encounters an INTEGER type THEN it SHALL use an IntegerTypeSymbol class
2. WHEN the semantic analyzer encounters a REAL type THEN it SHALL use a RealTypeSymbol class  
3. WHEN the semantic analyzer encounters a BOOLEAN type THEN it SHALL use a BooleanTypeSymbol class
4. WHEN the semantic analyzer encounters a CHAR type THEN it SHALL use a CharTypeSymbol class
5. WHEN these TypeSymbol classes are created THEN they SHALL inherit from a common TypeSymbol base class
6. WHEN TypeSymbol objects are used THEN they SHALL only be utilized within the SemanticAnalyzer, not in the Interpreter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer implementing type safety, I want TypeSymbol classes to support type operations so that semantic analysis can validate type compatibility and perform type calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two compatible TypeSymbol objects are added THEN the system SHALL return the appropriate result TypeSymbol
2. WHEN two IntegerTypeSymbol objects are added THEN it SHALL return an IntegerTypeSymbol
3. WHEN an IntegerTypeSymbol and RealTypeSymbol are added THEN it SHALL return a RealTypeSymbol
4. WHEN incompatible types are operated on THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate semantic errors
5. WHEN type operations are performed THEN they SHALL follow Pascal's type promotion and compatibility rules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with variable declarations, I want the type system to distinguish between mutable and immutable variables so that const declarations can be properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is declared with VAR THEN it SHALL be marked as mutable in the symbol table
2. WHEN a variable is declared with CONST THEN it SHALL be marked as immutable in the symbol table
3. WHEN an assignment is made to a const variable THEN the semantic analyzer SHALL raise an error
4. WHEN a const variable is used in expressions THEN it SHALL be allowed for reading but not modification
5. WHEN VarSymbol objects are created THEN they SHALL include mutability information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring type safety, I want the semantic analyzer to use TypeSymbol operations for expression validation so that type errors are caught at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the semantic analyzer visits a BinOp node THEN it SHALL validate operand types using TypeSymbol operations
2. WHEN the semantic analyzer visits an assignment THEN it SHALL validate type compatibility using TypeSymbol methods
3. WHEN the semantic analyzer encounters type mismatches THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages with type information
4. WHEN expressions involve multiple types THEN the analyzer SHALL determine the result type using TypeSymbol calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining code architecture, I want TypeSymbol classes to be completely separate from runtime Object classes so that compile-time and runtime concerns remain decoupled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeSymbol classes are implemented THEN they SHALL not be used in the Interpreter
2. WHEN Object classes are used in the Interpreter THEN they SHALL not be used in the SemanticAnalyzer
3. WHEN the system runs THEN TypeSymbol operations SHALL only occur during semantic analysis phase
4. WHEN runtime execution occurs THEN only Object classes SHALL be used for value representation and computation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with complex types, I want existing complex TypeSymbol classes to integrate seamlessly with the new basic TypeSymbol classes so that the entire type system works cohesively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ArrayTypeSymbol references element types THEN it SHALL work with both new basic TypeSymbols and existing complex TypeSymbols
2. WHEN RecordTypeSymbol contains field types THEN it SHALL support all TypeSymbol classes as field types
3. WHEN EnumTypeSymbol is used THEN it SHALL integrate properly with the enhanced type operation system
4. WHEN StringTypeSymbol operations are performed THEN they SHALL follow the same patterns as other TypeSymbol operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring backward compatibility, I want all existing functionality to continue working after the type system enhancement so that no regressions are introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing semantic analysis tests are run THEN they SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN existing interpreter tests are run THEN they SHALL continue to pass  
3. WHEN Pascal programs are compiled and executed THEN they SHALL produce the same results as before
4. WHEN error conditions are encountered THEN they SHALL produce appropriate error messages with enhanced type information
