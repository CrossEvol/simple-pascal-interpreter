# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete module system for the Pascal interpreter, enabling code organization through units and program-level imports. The module system will support the standard Pascal `unit` and `uses` syntax, allowing developers to create reusable code modules with clear interface/implementation separation and proper symbol scoping.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want to create reusable code units with interface/implementation separation, so that I can organize my code into logical modules and hide implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a unit file is parsed THEN the system SHALL recognize `unit UnitName;` declaration syntax
2. WHEN parsing a unit THEN the system SHALL distinguish between `interface` and `implementation` sections
3. WHEN parsing the interface section THEN the system SHALL allow type declarations, variable declarations, function/procedure signatures
4. WHEN parsing the implementation section THEN the system SHALL allow full function/procedure implementations and private declarations
5. WHEN a unit ends THEN the system SHALL require the `end.` terminator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want to import units into my programs using the `uses` clause, so that I can access functionality from other modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program contains a `uses` clause THEN the system SHALL parse the comma-separated list of unit names
2. WHEN processing a `uses` clause THEN the system SHALL locate and load the specified unit files
3. WHEN a unit is imported THEN the system SHALL make interface symbols available to the importing program
4. WHEN a unit is imported THEN the system SHALL NOT expose implementation-only symbols
5. IF a referenced unit cannot be found THEN the system SHALL report a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want proper symbol resolution across modules, so that I can reference functions, procedures, types, and variables from imported units.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resolving a symbol THEN the system SHALL first check the current scope, then imported units
2. WHEN multiple units define the same symbol THEN the system SHALL use the last imported unit's definition
3. WHEN a symbol is referenced THEN the system SHALL verify it exists in the interface section of the imported unit
4. WHEN a unit references another unit THEN the system SHALL support transitive dependencies
5. IF a symbol conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with unit names

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want units to have their own symbol tables and scoping rules, so that I can avoid naming conflicts and maintain encapsulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a unit is processed THEN the system SHALL create a separate symbol table for the unit
2. WHEN processing the interface section THEN the system SHALL mark symbols as publicly accessible
3. WHEN processing the implementation section THEN the system SHALL allow private symbols not visible externally
4. WHEN a unit imports other units THEN the system SHALL maintain proper scope hierarchy
5. WHEN symbol lookup occurs THEN the system SHALL respect visibility rules between interface and implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want standard library modules (Map, Math, ArrayUtils) to be available as external units, so that I can import and use standard functionality like any other module.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program uses a standard library module THEN the system SHALL locate and load the unit file from the standard library path
2. WHEN using Map unit THEN the system SHALL provide TMap class with put, get, remove, keys, values operations
3. WHEN using Math unit THEN the system SHALL provide ADD, MUL, SUB, DIV, MOD functions
4. WHEN using ArrayUtils unit THEN the system SHALL provide sort, find, copy, size procedures and functions
5. WHEN a standard library unit is missing THEN the system SHALL report a clear error with the expected file location

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Pascal developer, I want clear error messages for module-related issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix import problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a unit file has syntax errors THEN the system SHALL report the error with file name and line number
2. WHEN a circular dependency is detected THEN the system SHALL report all units involved in the cycle
3. WHEN an imported symbol is not found THEN the system SHALL suggest available symbols from the unit
4. WHEN a unit file is missing THEN the system SHALL report the expected file location
5. WHEN interface/implementation mismatch occurs THEN the system SHALL identify the specific symbol causing the issue
